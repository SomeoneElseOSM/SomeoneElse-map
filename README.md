# SomeoneElse-map

This is a simple Leaflet map for map display.  It's used at [map.atownsend.org.uk](https://map.atownsend.org.uk) to show the maps and overlays that you can see there.

For more information about that map style see [here](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-style), [here](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/openstreetmap-carto-AJT) and [here](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-style-legend).
